                    Will Smith: A Biography portrays Smith's West Philadelphia upbringing,
                    his arrival and ascent in Hollywood, and his family life with wife and fellow actor,
                    Jada Pinkett, and their children. It covers Smith's successes in three mediums: music,

                    Grammy for rap; the wildly popular television show, "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air;" and
                    his movie successes, from roles in blockbusters like Independence Day, Men in Black, and
                    I Am Legend, to critically acclaimed, award-winning performances in Ali and The Pursuit
                    of Happyness.
                    The book also details his increasing presence as a film producer.

                    These are the stories and adventures of a young African-American man named Deacon Foster,
                    a Detective who was chosen by God to speak His word boldly and courageously in the face of
                    opposition. God has given him strength and sight into the spiritual realm, to battle the
                    schemes and strategies of Satan, as well as battle the evil spirits that followed him and
                    were banished from heaven. Deacon is the voice of Biblical perspective on controversial
                    issues in today’s society. He exemplifies a man of godly character and integrity; and
                    will be an example of Jesus’ love and accountability. Deacon is in a battle against crime
                    in the city of Atlanta, but knows the influence behind it all is of evil spiritual origin.
                    On the opposite side of the spectrum we have Drexler Cohen, a powerful business owner with
                    political influence who is setting up the world to receive the Anti-Christ. He is behind
                    the chaos, violence, and crime throughout the world. So much so, that the world will seek
                    peace from anywhere. Cohen is essentially under the influence of an evil spirit who is
                    high ranking in Satan’s army of fallen angels. As Deacon wars against crime and evil spirits,
                    we also see aspects of his Christian walk in his personal life, his willingness to serve,
                    and his love and compassion for others.
